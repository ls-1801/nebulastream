# DevContainer Testing Feedback
**Tester**: jasper (Tester 2: Build and System Test)
**PR**: https://github.com/ls-1801/nebulastream/pull/5
**Date**: 2026-01-20

## Summary
**Verdict: PASS** - The devcontainer setup works well for building and testing nebulastream.

## Setup Experience
| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Ease of setup | Good | `devcontainer up` worked out of the box |
| Image availability | Good | Docker image already cached locally |
| Container startup | Good | Started successfully with proper user mapping |

## Build Results
- **CMake configuration**: SUCCESS using `cmake --preset debug`
- **Build compilation**: SUCCESS (with caching via volume mount)
- **Minor issue**: Non-fatal git worktree warning (cosmetic only)

## System Test Results
- **Tests executed**: 21 system tests
- **Pass rate**: 95% (20/21 passed)
- **Failed test**: `systest_interpreter_HASH_JOIN` - libc++ termination (pre-existing issue)

## What Works Well
1. CMakePresets.json provides clean configuration interface
2. vscode user with UID mapping works correctly
3. clangd configuration points to correct compile_commands.json path
4. Volume mount for build cache improves rebuild performance
5. sccache environment variables ready for CI-like caching

## Recommendations
1. Add health check/smoke test on container startup
2. Mention `ctest --preset debug` in postCreateCommand documentation
3. Consider adding troubleshooting section for common issues

## Detailed Commands Used
```bash
# Start devcontainer
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .

# Configure
cmake --preset debug

# Build
cmake --build --preset debug

# Test
ctest --preset debug -R systest
```
