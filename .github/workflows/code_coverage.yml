name: Code Coverage
description: |
  This workflow is triggered by the pr.yml workflow.
  We are using this workflow to build the code coverage for the PR branches.
  To get the code coverage, we use codecov which operates on lcov files generated by building with the flag CODE_COVERAGE=ON and running the tests.
  The test have a timeout of 90 minutes, as building the code coverage can take a long time.
on:
  # We are using this yaml in other workflows, e.g., nightly or PR, so we need to allow another workflow call to trigger this workflow.
  # We are expecting the tag of the docker image to be passed as an output from the previous job.
